# PhasmoGuide

Personal Project made for the game Phasomophobia. It allows the user to enter the evidences to guess the ghost type while in game. The bot can be added to your discord server and act as a wiki for the game. However, the `storage.json` is not up to date with the current game version and will need updated.
